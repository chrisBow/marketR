# marketR
A package for R that includes common, easy to use analysis functions for marketers.

This is my first attempt at building a package for R. It's purpose is to provide an easy to use set of functions for marketers to perform data analysis on a number of types of data.

The package is designed for marketers in smaller organisations who may not have a background in statistics or data analysis, and who may be responsible for managing campaigns and need to be able to analyse performance to improve ROI and optimise campaign settings and budgets.

The functions of the package will provide an easy way for marketers who haven't used R before to perform a number of tests to analyse their datasets, gain insight, prepare reports and aid in decision making.

The timeline is to have an initial working version of the package ready for alpha testing by the end of June 2018.
