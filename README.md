# marketR
A package for R that includes common, easy to use analysis functions for marketers.

This is my first attempt at building a package for R. It's purpose is to provide an easy to use set of functions for marketers to perform data analysis on a number of types of data.

The timeline is to have an initial working version of the package ready for alpha testing by the end of June 2018.
